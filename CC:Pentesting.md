# CC:Pentesting Write-Up

A TryHackMe beginner level room, which provides an introduction to various tools and concepts commonly encountered in penetration testing

## Deploy the machine
Turn on OpenVPN on your machine to connect to corresponding server

If you don't have OpenVPN, then go download it and type 'sudo openvpn <OpenVPN_filename>' in terminal

## [Section 1 - Network Utilities] - nmap

nmap = 'Network Mapper'

nmap -> allows a pen tester to see which ports are open, and information about which services are running on those ports

```language
-p : specify which ports to scan
-sn: ping scan
-sU: UDP scan
-sC: run default scripts
-sV: show versions of services
-A : aggressive mode (enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning and traceroute)
-O : enable OS detection
```

### 1. How many ports are open on the machine?
```bash
	nmap -sC -sV -oN <IP_Address>
```
#### answer: 1

### 2. What service is running on the machine?
refer to information above
#### answer: Apache

### 3. What is the version of the service?
refer to information above
#### answer: 2.4.18

### 4. What is the output of the http-title script(included in default scripts)?

## [Section 1 - Network Utilities] - Netcat

nc -> allow users to connect to specific ports and send and receive data

Types of shells

1: Bind Shell
A type of shell in which the target machine opens up a communication port or a listener on the victim machine and waits for an incoming connection. The attacker then connects to the victim machineâ€™s listener which then leads to code or command execution on the server.

2: Reverse Shell
A type of shell in which the target machine communicates back to the attacking machine. The attacking machine has a listener port on which it receives the connection, which by using, code or command execution is achieved.

```
-l : listen for connections
-v : enable verbose mode (allow you to see who connected to you)
-p : specify a port to listen on
-e : specify which porgram to execute after connecting to a host
-u : UDP mode
```
